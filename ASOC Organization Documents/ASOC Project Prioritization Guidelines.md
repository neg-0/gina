# **Atlas Strategic Operations Command (ASOC) Project Prioritization Guidelines**

### **1. Purpose**

The purpose of this document is to provide a structured framework for evaluating, scoring, and prioritizing project ideas and proposals within **Atlas Strategic Operations Command (ASOC)**. These guidelines ensure that each project is assessed on its alignment with ASOC’s mission, strategic vision, and core objectives while considering resource requirements, risks, and potential impacts.

The prioritization process allows ASOC to maintain focus on high-value projects that deliver significant operational, technological, or strategic benefits.

### **2. Key Evaluation Criteria**

Projects will be evaluated across multiple criteria, with each criterion being assigned a weight based on its relative importance to the organization’s current goals. Projects that score highest in total will be prioritized for resource allocation, development, and deployment.

The **Key Evaluation Criteria** are as follows:

### **2.1. Strategic Alignment (Weight: 30%)**

- **Description**: The extent to which the project aligns with ASOC’s long-term strategic goals, vision, and mission. Projects that directly support the strategic pillars of **Technological Dominance**, **Operational Readiness**, and **Space and Cyber Dominance** will receive higher scores.
- **Key Questions**:
  - Does this project align with one or more of ASOC’s core objectives?
  - How does this project contribute to ASOC’s **Strategic Vision 2030**?
- **Scoring**:
  - **5**: Project is integral to a core strategic goal.
  - **3-4**: Project supports important strategic initiatives but is not mission-critical.
  - **1-2**: Project has minimal or indirect alignment with strategic goals.

### **2.2. Operational Value and Impact (Weight: 25%)**

- **Description**: The operational benefits that the project will deliver, including improvements in efficiency, mission readiness, and overall force effectiveness.
- **Key Questions**:
  - How will this project improve operational capabilities?
  - What measurable outcomes are expected from this project (e.g., increased mission success rate, resource efficiency)?
- **Scoring**:
  - **5**: High operational impact, directly improving mission-critical capabilities.
  - **3-4**: Moderate operational impact with clear benefits to non-critical operations.
  - **1-2**: Limited or minimal operational impact.

### **2.3. Innovation and Technological Advancement (Weight: 20%)**

- **Description**: Projects that push the boundaries of current technologies and introduce innovative solutions will be prioritized. This includes initiatives that incorporate AI, autonomous systems, cybersecurity measures, or space technologies.
- **Key Questions**:
  - Does this project introduce new, cutting-edge technologies?
  - Does it significantly advance ASOC’s technical capabilities in key areas (AI, cyber, space, etc.)?
- **Scoring**:
  - **5**: Project introduces groundbreaking innovations that can transform operations.
  - **3-4**: Project offers moderate technological improvements but is based on existing methods.
  - **1-2**: Project uses established technologies with little innovation.

### **2.4. Effort, Resources, and Feasibility (Weight: 15%)**

- **Description**: The effort required to develop and deploy the project, including resource allocation (budget, personnel, time). Projects that can be executed efficiently with available resources will score higher.
- **Key Questions**:
  - What is the projected time to completion?
  - Are the necessary resources available for the project’s success (budget, manpower, technology)?
  - Are there significant challenges or risks that may delay the project?
- **Scoring**:
  - **5**: High feasibility, realistic timelines, and optimal resource allocation.
  - **3-4**: Moderate resource requirements with some risks or delays expected.
  - **1-2**: High resource demands or low feasibility, significant challenges expected.

### **2.5. Risk and Compliance (Weight: 10%)**

- **Description**: An assessment of the potential risks involved in the project, including technical, operational, or security risks. This criterion also examines compliance with ASOC’s risk management protocols and defense standards.
- **Key Questions**:
  - What are the major risks associated with this project?
  - How will this project comply with defense and organizational regulations (cybersecurity, ethics, etc.)?
- **Scoring**:
  - **5**: Low risk and full compliance with defense standards.
  - **3-4**: Moderate risks that are manageable, with partial compliance.
  - **1-2**: High risks or significant compliance challenges.

### **3. Prioritization Process**

Each project submission will be assessed using the above criteria. Each criterion will be assigned a score between **1 (lowest)** and **5 (highest)**, which will then be multiplied by its respective weight. The total score for each project will determine its overall priority.

The steps in the prioritization process are as follows:

1. **Initial Submission**:

   - Projects are submitted by teams, departments, or individuals using the **ASOC Project Submission Survey**. All relevant details, including the project’s goals, scope, resource requirements, and expected impact, must be provided.

2. **Preliminary Assessment**:

   - A review panel composed of ASOC leadership and subject matter experts will conduct an initial assessment of the project’s scope, feasibility, and alignment with ASOC’s objectives.

3. **Detailed Scoring**:

   - Each member of the review panel will score the project using the criteria outlined in this document. Scores will be averaged to ensure fairness and objectivity.

4. **Resource Allocation**:

   - Projects with the highest scores will be allocated the necessary resources (budget, personnel, and technology) based on the organization’s capacity.

5. **Ongoing Review**:
   - Projects will be continuously reviewed throughout their development cycle to ensure they remain aligned with their original goals and that they adapt to any changes in strategic priorities.

### **4. Example Scoring Sheet**

| **Evaluation Criteria**            | **Weight** | **Score (1-5)** | **Weighted Score** |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| **Strategic Alignment**            | 30%        | 4               | 1.2                |

### **5. Approval and Rejection Guidelines**

**High-Priority Projects**:

- Projects with scores above **4.0** are considered **high priority** and will receive immediate resource allocation. These projects are likely to have significant strategic value and operational impact, and their feasibility is high.

**Medium-Priority Projects**:

- Projects scoring between **3.0 and 4.0** are considered **moderate priority**. These projects will be pursued when resources are available, but they may not receive immediate funding or personnel allocation.

**Low-Priority Projects**:

- Projects scoring below **3.0** are considered **low priority** and will be reassessed before further development. These projects may be delayed, re-scoped, or rejected if they do not meet the strategic needs of ASOC.

### **6. Continuous Review and Adjustment**

ASOC’s strategic objectives and resource availability will evolve over time. Therefore, the prioritization of projects must remain **flexible** and **adaptive** to changing conditions. Regular reviews of ongoing projects will be conducted, with adjustments made based on:

1. **New strategic priorities**.
2. **Changes in technology**.
3. **Resource constraints**.
4. **Evolving threats and global conditions**.

Projects can be upgraded, downgraded, or restructured as needed.

### **7. Conclusion**

The **ASOC Project Prioritization Guidelines** provide a transparent, structured approach to evaluating and prioritizing new projects. This ensures that resources are allocated efficiently, with a focus on advancing ASOC’s mission and contributing to its **Strategic Vision 2030**. By using these guidelines, ASOC will continue to develop and deploy cutting-edge technologies that support its leadership in modern defense operations.
