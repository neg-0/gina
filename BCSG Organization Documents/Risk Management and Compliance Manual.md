# **Risk Management and Compliance Manual**

### **Baker Combat Support Group (BCSG)**

---

## **Introduction**

The **Baker Combat Support Group (BCSG)** operates in a complex and dynamic environment where operational risks must be carefully managed to ensure mission success. This manual provides a structured approach for identifying, evaluating, mitigating, and monitoring risks across the unit's operations, while ensuring strict adherence to compliance requirements.

BCSG's **Risk Management and Compliance Program** ensures that all divisions within the unit remain prepared to address operational risks proactively and respond to emerging threats. Compliance with applicable regulations and policies, both internal and external, is critical to maintaining operational integrity.

---

## **Purpose**

This manual serves to:

- Establish standardized procedures for risk management and compliance within BCSG.
- Promote a proactive approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks.
- Ensure compliance with internal BCSG policies, Department of Defense (DoD) regulations, and applicable external laws.
- Protect the operational and reputational integrity of BCSG by promoting a culture of risk awareness and accountability.

## **Risk Management Framework**

### **1. Risk Identification**

All divisions within BCSG are responsible for regularly identifying potential risks to their operations. This includes:

- **Operational Risks**: Threats to mission success, delays in supply chains, and resource shortages.
- **Compliance Risks**: Risks related to non-compliance with DoD regulations, environmental standards, or personnel policies.
- **Technical Risks**: Failures or vulnerabilities in technology, such as communication breakdowns, system malfunctions, or data breaches.
- **Strategic Risks**: Risks associated with long-term goals, resource allocations, or shifts in leadership priorities.

**Risk Identification Procedures**:

- Conduct **quarterly risk assessments** across all divisions.
- Hold **risk identification workshops** with key leadership and personnel to gather input on potential risks.
- Review **lessons learned** from past projects or missions to identify recurring risks.

### **2. Risk Assessment**

Once risks are identified, they will be evaluated for **likelihood** and **impact** using the following framework:

#### **Risk Likelihood Categories**:

- **High (3 Points)**: The risk is likely to occur within the current operational cycle.
- **Moderate (2 Points)**: The risk may occur within the next few operational cycles.
- **Low (1 Point)**: The risk is unlikely to occur in the near term.

#### **Risk Impact Categories**:

- **High Impact (3 Points)**: The risk could significantly disrupt operations, result in mission failure, or cause substantial financial losses.
- **Moderate Impact (2 Points)**: The risk could cause temporary disruptions, delays, or moderate financial losses.
- **Low Impact (1 Point)**: The risk would have minimal effect on operations or finances.

### **Risk Prioritization Matrix**:

| **Likelihood / Impact** | **Low Impact** | **Moderate Impact** | **High Impact** |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| **Low Likelihood**      | 1              | 2                   | 3               |
| **Moderate Likelihood** | 2              | 4                   | 6               |
| **High Likelihood**     | 3              | 6                   | 9               |

**Risk Categories**:

- **Low Risk**: Total score of 1-3. These risks will be managed at the divisional level with minimal oversight.
- **Moderate Risk**: Total score of 4-6. These risks require proactive monitoring and periodic review by unit leadership.
- **High Risk**: Total score of 7-9. These risks must be escalated to the **Risk Management Committee** for immediate mitigation planning.

### **3. Risk Mitigation and Response Planning**

For each identified risk, a mitigation plan will be developed to reduce either the likelihood or the impact. Risk mitigation strategies include:

- **Avoidance**: Eliminate the conditions that give rise to the risk.
- **Mitigation**: Take steps to reduce the severity or likelihood of the risk (e.g., redundancy in supply chains, enhanced personnel training).
- **Transfer**: Shift the risk to another entity, such as through contractual agreements.
- **Acceptance**: Recognize the risk but choose not to act, typically for low-impact, low-likelihood risks.

### **4. Risk Monitoring and Reporting**

All risks must be regularly monitored and reported on through the following mechanisms:

- **Quarterly Risk Reports**: Each division will submit a report on the current status of identified risks, mitigation actions taken, and emerging risks.
- **Risk Dashboard**: Leadership will maintain a **Risk Dashboard** that visually tracks high and moderate risks across all divisions.
- **Incident Response Reports**: In the event that a risk materializes, the affected division will complete an **Incident Response Report**, documenting the impact, response, and lessons learned.

## **Compliance Framework**

### **1. Compliance Policies**

All BCSG operations must comply with:

- **DoD Directives**: All defense operations must adhere to the latest directives issued by the Department of Defense.
- **Environmental Regulations**: BCSG will comply with all relevant environmental standards, including those related to energy use, waste management, and pollution prevention.
- **Personnel and Safety Regulations**: Compliance with DoD personnel policies, including safety standards, workplace conduct, and equal opportunity guidelines, is mandatory.
- **Data Security and Privacy**: Compliance with data protection regulations, including DoD cybersecurity standards and privacy policies, is critical to safeguarding sensitive information.

### **2. Compliance Audits**

To ensure ongoing compliance, the following audit procedures are implemented:

- **Annual Internal Audits**: BCSG will conduct an internal audit of all divisions to ensure compliance with internal and external regulations.
- **DoD External Audits**: Prepare for periodic audits by DoD authorities. All divisions are required to maintain accurate and up-to-date records.
- **Spot Audits**: Leadership reserves the right to conduct unannounced spot audits on key areas of compliance, particularly in high-risk divisions.

### **3. Non-Compliance Reporting**

Non-compliance incidents must be reported immediately to the **Compliance Officer**. The following reporting structure will be adhered to:

- **Immediate Reporting**: Any violation of DoD policy, environmental regulations, or personnel guidelines must be reported within 24 hours.
- **Corrective Action Plans**: In the event of a compliance violation, the responsible division must submit a **Corrective Action Plan** within 5 business days. This plan will outline the root cause, corrective measures, and timeline for remediation.

### **4. Compliance Training**

All BCSG personnel are required to complete **annual compliance training**, covering the latest regulations in their areas of responsibility. Training will include:

- **Operational Compliance**: Ensuring all personnel are aware of the policies and procedures that apply to their roles.
- **Data Security**: Mandatory cybersecurity and data privacy training to ensure compliance with DoD and federal regulations.
- **Environmental Compliance**: Environmental training focused on waste management, energy use, and pollution prevention.

## **Governance and Oversight**

### **1. Risk Management Committee**

BCSG will establish a **Risk Management Committee** that meets **quarterly** to:

- Review and assess all high and moderate risks.
- Approve or revise risk mitigation plans.
- Oversee the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies and compliance efforts.

### **2. Compliance Officer**

The **Compliance Officer** is responsible for ensuring that all units adhere to DoD, environmental, and internal BCSG policies. The Compliance Officer will:
