# **BCSG Project Prioritization Guidelines**

## **Purpose**

The purpose of this document is to establish clear and objective criteria for prioritizing projects within the **Baker Combat Support Group (BCSG)**. This framework will ensure that limited resources are allocated to projects that provide the highest value to the unit, while maintaining alignment with BCSG's **Strategic Vision** and **Commander’s Intent**. It will also help identify and de-prioritize projects that are unlikely to yield significant benefits or that pose undue risk.

## **Prioritization Criteria**

All projects within BCSG will be evaluated and ranked based on the following five key criteria. Each project will receive a score in each category, and these scores will be used to determine overall priority. The higher the total score, the higher the project's priority.

### **1. Strategic Alignment (0-5 Points)**

This criterion measures how well the project aligns with BCSG's **Strategic Vision** and overall mission.

- **5 Points**: The project is directly aligned with one or more of the top strategic goals (e.g., operational efficiency, innovation, cross-divisional collaboration).
- **3 Points**: The project aligns with secondary strategic objectives but is not a direct driver of core goals.
- **1 Point**: The project is tangentially related to the unit’s goals, with limited strategic impact.
- **0 Points**: The project does not align with any aspect of the unit’s strategic goals.

### **2. Operational Impact (0-5 Points)**

This criterion assesses the project's potential to improve or enhance BCSG’s operational capabilities, either in terms of process efficiency, mission support, or personnel engagement.

- **5 Points**: The project will have a transformative impact on BCSG operations, resulting in significant improvements in efficiency, mission success, or personnel effectiveness.
- **3 Points**: The project will result in moderate improvements in one or more key operational areas.
- **1 Point**: The project will have a minor, incremental impact on operations.
- **0 Points**: The project will have no significant impact on operations or may create additional operational burdens.

### **3. Resource Requirements (0-5 Points)**

This criterion evaluates the resources (time, personnel, budget, etc.) required to complete the project, as well as the feasibility of securing these resources.

- **5 Points**: The project requires minimal resources and can be completed with existing personnel and budget. Highly feasible.
- **3 Points**: The project requires moderate resources but is within reach with some reallocation or minor budget adjustments.
- **1 Point**: The project requires significant resources and will strain current capacity, but it is still feasible with major trade-offs.
- **0 Points**: The project requires excessive resources beyond the unit’s capability or is unlikely to be feasible with available resources.

### **4. Risk and Complexity (0-5 Points)**

This criterion assesses the potential risks associated with the project, including technical complexity, operational disruption, or the possibility of failure.

- **5 Points**: The project has low risk and is straightforward to implement with minimal complexity.
- **3 Points**: The project has moderate risk, but potential challenges can be managed or mitigated effectively.
- **1 Point**: The project has significant risk or complexity, requiring careful management and planning.
- **0 Points**: The project is highly complex or risky, with a high probability of failure or substantial operational disruption.

### **5. Innovation and Long-Term Benefit (0-5 Points)**

This criterion measures the project’s potential to drive innovation within BCSG and provide long-term benefits beyond immediate operational improvements.

- **5 Points**: The project is highly innovative, has the potential to create lasting change, and will position BCSG as a leader in its field.
- **3 Points**: The project introduces new ideas or methods that could result in moderate long-term benefits or continuous improvement.
- **1 Point**: The project involves minor improvements or incremental innovation, with limited long-term impact.
- **0 Points**: The project does not introduce any innovative elements or long-term benefits.

## **Prioritization Process**

### **1. Project Submission**

All proposed projects must first be submitted through the **BCSG Project Submission Survey**. The survey will capture key details about the project, including objectives, resource requirements, and alignment with strategic goals.

### **2. Scoring**

Once submitted, each project will be reviewed by the **BCSG Leadership Team** and scored based on the five criteria outlined above. Each criterion will be scored on a 0-5 point scale, with a maximum possible score of 25 points.

### **3. Weighted Prioritization (Optional)**

In some cases, certain criteria may carry more weight depending on current unit priorities. For example, if **operational impact** is deemed more important than **innovation** in the current fiscal year, that criterion may be given more weight in the final calculation. The Leadership Team will decide whether weights need to be adjusted for specific periods.

### **4. Ranking**

Projects will be ranked based on their total score, with the highest-scoring projects receiving the highest priority. In cases where multiple projects receive the same score, the project with the higher score in the **Strategic Alignment** and **Operational Impact** criteria will be prioritized.

## **Special Considerations**

### **Urgent Operational Needs**

While most projects will follow the standard prioritization process, **urgent operational needs** (e.g., unplanned mission-critical requirements) may bypass the scoring process and be immediately elevated in priority. These cases will be handled directly by the **Commander** and the **Leadership Team**.

### **Budget Constraints**

In years of tight budget constraints, projects with a score of **3 or lower** in the **Resource Requirements** category will automatically be deprioritized, regardless of their total score. This ensures that resources are reserved for projects that provide the highest return on investment.

### **Innovation Initiative Quota**

Each year, a minimum of **two innovative projects** must be approved, regardless of their initial prioritization score. This ensures that BCSG continues to foster a culture of innovation and long-term thinking, even during periods of operational stress.

---

## **Review and Adjustment**

### **Quarterly Review**

The **Leadership Team** will conduct a **quarterly review** of all ongoing projects. During this review, projects may be re-scored if significant changes occur, such as new risks emerging, resource availability shifting, or mission priorities changing.

### **Mid-Project Adjustments**

In cases where a project encounters unforeseen obstacles, it may be paused, canceled, or reprioritized based on a mid-project review. Teams are encouraged to submit regular progress reports and flag any emerging issues early.

## **Conclusion**

The BCSG **Project Prioritization Guidelines** provide a structured approach for evaluating and ranking projects based on their strategic value, operational impact, feasibility, and innovation potential. By following this process, we ensure that limited resources are directed toward projects that deliver the greatest benefits to the unit while maintaining alignment with our long-term goals and vision.
