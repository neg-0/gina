# **Commanderâ€™s Intent Document: Baker Combat Support Group (BCSG)**

### **Commander: Colonel James "Cal" Weston**

## **Mission**

The **Baker Combat Support Group (BCSG)** will continue its core mission of providing critical operational and logistical support across all assigned missions while simultaneously working to streamline processes, increase efficiency, and create a culture of accountability and innovation.

---

## **Commander's Intent Overview**

The BCSG has, for too long, been plagued by inefficiencies, a lack of coordination, and low morale. My intent is to shift the culture toward one of **ownership, calculated risk-taking**, and **long-term operational effectiveness**. We will not transform overnight, but we will make deliberate strides to modernize our approach and encourage innovation at every level of the organization.

The way forward includes addressing outdated procedures, fostering collaboration across teams, and empowering leaders and personnel alike to think critically and act with purpose.

---

## **Key Priorities**

### **1. Promote Calculated Risk-Taking and Ownership**

I expect all leaders to encourage their teams to take **calculated risks** where necessary. While following procedures is important, we must be able to adapt to new challenges and avoid the paralysis that results from rigid adherence to outdated practices. Leaders should actively create an environment where team members feel safe to propose improvements and take responsibility for their outcomes.

### **2. Streamline Bureaucratic Processes**

The current operational processes within BCSG are overly bureaucratic and inefficient. My intent is to reduce redundant approval layers and empower team leads to make decisions that expedite tasks without sacrificing accountability. Leaders must work collaboratively to identify outdated or unnecessary processes and propose **practical, low-risk reforms**.

### **3. Focus on Small, Achievable Wins**

I recognize that sweeping reforms are unrealistic in the short term. Therefore, I want all divisions to focus on achieving **small, tangible improvements**. These quick wins will help build momentum and demonstrate the value of change, both to personnel and leadership. I encourage the **Operations Division** and the **Logistics and Supply Team** to prioritize projects that deliver immediate operational benefits, such as reducing procurement times and improving mission planning coordination.

### **4. Build Team Morale and Engagement**

Morale across the unit is low, and this must be addressed with urgency. Leaders must prioritize **recognition** of individual and team contributions, even in small ways. While there may be limited resources for large-scale programs, team leaders are encouraged to explore **low-cost, high-impact initiatives** to foster a more positive work environment. This can be as simple as creating better communication channels or recognizing team members during regular meetings.

### **5. Cross-Divisional Collaboration**

Each division within BCSG currently operates in **silos**, which is contributing to inefficiency and duplication of effort. I expect cross-functional teams to be formed where necessary to address complex challenges, and I encourage a culture of **knowledge-sharing**. The **Innovation Working Group** will play a key role in this, acting as a bridge between the different divisions to identify opportunities for collaboration and improvement.

## **Guiding Principles**

1. **Calculated Risk Over Rigid Compliance**: We will continue to comply with regulations, but only to the extent that they serve our mission. Leaders are expected to weigh the risks of action versus inaction and, when appropriate, take calculated risks to expedite operations and improve efficiency.

2. **Transparency and Communication**: All leaders must ensure that their team members understand not just the tasks they are assigned but the purpose behind them. Transparency in decision-making and clear communication up and down the chain of command are vital to ensuring everyone is aligned with our mission and objectives.

3. **Empowerment of Personnel**: The success of our mission will depend on the engagement and empowerment of our personnel. Leaders must take the time to assess the strengths of their teams, providing opportunities for personnel to work on projects that best utilize their talents.

---

## **End State**

By the end of the year, I expect BCSG to have established a foundation for continuous improvement. Our processes will be streamlined, morale will begin to rise, and we will start to see the benefits of empowering personnel to take calculated risks. While resistance to change is expected, we will address this with persistence and clear, demonstrable progress. Each division will have a clear path toward measurable, incremental improvements in both their day-to-day operations and long-term project outcomes.

---

### **Closing Remarks**

We are all in this together. I expect every member of the BCSG, from leadership to junior personnel, to contribute to making our unit more efficient, more responsive, and more innovative. While the path ahead will be difficult, I am confident that through collaboration, calculated risk-taking, and a commitment to progress, we will overcome the challenges that have long hindered this unit.
